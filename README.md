# Gov Hack - Citizen Science

## Tableau DashBoard

The Tableau dashboard is functionated as the interactive platform between our team and the citizens, future Moblie APP users, govenment and other organizations. Our dashboard is connected with the MongoDB server, while the collected data is updated in realtime. Individuals and organizations can make use of this dashboard by checking the potion of mask wearers to help in decision making. The data could also be analyzed in a modeling as a statistically significant feature.

### HeatMap of analystics on Mask Wearers by postcode

The user can set filters on dates and time to get self-defined data, while also able to see the mask wearing trend in different areas by time.

### Infographics

The infographics and highlighted statistics help users be aware of the mask wearing issue, which encourages them to download the mobile app.

### Mobile Version - could be incorporated in the MaskCount App 

The Mobile version dashboard imporved user experience.

### Data We Used in Desmonstration

Because we are aiming at developing a mobile application for collecting data, the mock-data we used is purely randomly generated and not biased, which would be use for the demonstration only.

### Future Possibilities on Data Science

There could be a lot of perspectives on how to use and analyse the collected data of mask wearing, including finding its correlation with the majority human race in different areas by postcode, its correlation with police forces, its correlation with the Covid-19 daily growth rates. We could also generate new features like classifications on mask consumption for Data Science modeling usage.
